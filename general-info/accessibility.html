            <p>
				During the general conference, Code4Lib {{site.data.conf.year}} will feature live captioning by "20/20 Captioning". In order to improve the quality of this service, we ask everyone to speak slowly and clearly so the captioning service is able to accurately capture what you say.
				{% if site.data.conf.closed-captioning.show %}
					Attendees, both local and remote, may view the text stream at:
               		<a href="{{site.data.conf.closed-captioning.url}}">{{site.data.conf.closed-captioning.url}}</a>.
				{% endif %}
				These transcriptions will be applied to the captioning on the YouTube archive soon after the completion of the conference.

            <h2 id="quietroom">Quiet Room</h2>
            <p>
				For the General Conference days, room {{site.data.conf.quiet-room.location}} will serve as a <em>quiet room</em> at the conference venue. The purpose of this room is to provide a quiet space so that attendees can take a mental or physical break from the many goings on. The room is open to all attendees during the conference hours.
            </p>
            <p>
               If you use the Quiet Room, we ask you to abide by the following rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>The quiet space is not for private discussions or meetings. Any talking should be brief and kept to a whisper.</li>
               <li>While in the room, please turn off or silence any electronics, especially cellphones. This is not a space to make phone calls, catch up on emails, or otherwise do work. This is a space to relax.
               </li>
               <li>If you want to listen to music, watch a video, etc., please wear headphones and keep the volume low. If someone asks you to further turn down the volume, please do so.</li>
               <li>Personal belongings should not be left unattended.</li>
               <li>Please leave the space in the same condition (or better) as you found it.</li>
               <li>Food and drink is permitted but avoid noisy foods or anything with strong odors. </li>
               <li>We will attempt to generally keep the lights as low as possible while maintaining a safe space.</li>
               <li>Above all, respect your fellow conference goers in this space so that all of you can find a bit of quiet.</li>
			   <li>Please respect any requests for social distancing or mask wearing in this space.</li>
            </ul>

				<h2 id="platform">Conference Platform Accessibility</h2>
				<p>
					Code4Lib {{ site.data.conf.year }} will be using Whova as the conference platform. In general, the platform is accessible, but it is missing landmarks and headers on pages. You can <a href="https://github.com/terrill/whova-a11y-fix">install a userscript</a> in your browser (Tampermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for Firefox) that will create landmarks and headers. The userscript is not available for Safari. For assistance, contact <a href="mailto:{{site.data.conf.accessibility-email}}">{{site.data.conf.accessibility-email}}</a>.

            <p>
				Code4Lib encourages all of its presenters to produce and deliver accessible talks. A guide to accessible presentations will be available soon.

			<h2 id="microphones">Microphone Usage</h2>
            <p> The single greatest act you can to do to promote accessibility at Code4Lib {{site.data.conf.year}} is to use the microphone. It doesn't matter if you think you are loud or you can project, you should use the microphone. It benefits everyone:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>When a speaker uses the mic properly, you all hear them better.</li>
               <li>When you ask a question with a mic, the speaker and everyone else hears your question.</li>
               <li>Using the mic ensures everyone livestreaming or watching recorded talks can share the C4L experience.</li>
               <li>Using the mic improves the quality of the live captioning feed.</li>
            </ul>

			<h3>Using a Microphone</h3>
			<p>Generally, the line of the microphone should always point towards your mouth and nose. For a handheld mic, hold it like a candy bar or at a 45 degree angle. Position a podium mic towards you.</p>

			<h3>Audience Microphones</h3>
			<p>Desk microphones are built into every seat in the main conference venue for Q&A with presenters.</p>
