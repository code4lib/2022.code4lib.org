                <h2>Code4Lib is a vibrant and diverse community.</h2>
                <p>
                    We are developers and technologists for libraries, museums, and
                    archives who have a strong commitment to open technologies.
                    <a href="https://code4lib.org/">Code4Lib</a> began as a simple
                    <a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/MailingList">mailing list</a>
                    in 2003 and held its first face-to-face meeting in 2005 in Chicago.
                    The first official annual conference was held in 2006 in Corvallis,
                    Oregon.
                    Nowadays, the Code4Lib community gravitates around the same listserv,
                    an annual conference with hundreds of attendees, as well as
                    <a href="https://code4lib.org/irc/">IRC and Slack channels</a>
                    that are open for anyone to join.
                    We are dedicated to being a diverse and inclusive community of
                    technologists seeking to share ideas and build collaboration.

                Cast year string to int then iterate down, we can go back as far
                as the first Jekyll site from 2016 (Philadelphia).
