		<p>
			As part of our ongoing pursuit of an increasingly accessible Code4Lib experience, we are improving the conference's speaker page by providing <em>more descriptive</em> alternative text for the speaker images. Instead of just repeating the person's name, we are asking all speakers to provide a short description of their provided image. The provided text will be set as the <i><code>alt</code></i> text but also made visible alongside the bios as shown in the screenshot.

					Cartoon avatar of a quite pale white bespectacled brunette geek girl whose open downturned mouth is adamantly advocating an important point or three. A bookcase is behind her.

		<h2>How to Write a Speaker Image Description</h2>
		<p>
			Writing effective alt text for images can be challenging, so we provide the following guidance for writing an accessible description of your speaker photo.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Accessible descriptions should be informative but succinct. We recommend not exceeding around 200 characters.
			</li>
			<li>
				Avoid saying words like "headshot", "photo", "image", etc. As this is a page of speakers, there is an assumption that such images will be present. If your speaker image is a cartoon or digital avatar, do mention that. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Describe what is most important in the image. How do you want to come across in the description? What would you want a sighted person to take away from the image?  It is important to not describe everything but only what matters most. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Emotion matters. Convey the mood your picture is showing. Is your smile friendly and welcoming or does it reveal a bit of mischief? Are you having fun in the photo or are you stoically serious? Sharing these aspects enriches the alt text experience.
			</li>
			<li>
				As far as you are comfortable, convey your identities such as race, ethnicity, gender, visual disabilities, etc. Sighted users can readily ascertain the diversity of a conference's speakers but screen reader users have to reply on what is stated in alt text or make assumptions based on a name. Otherwise, misinterpretations and defaulting to the majority may happen.
			</li>
			<li>
				For describing race, one can describe their skin color or explicitly identify with a race. Similarly, for gender, one can explicitly name their gender or describe aspects of gender such as hair, makeup, and clothing. The level of detail is up to you. 
			</li>
			<li> 
				Describe any actions in the photo. Are you holding or wielding something? Hanging upside down from monkey bars? These add to the emotion of the image.
			</li>
		</ul>
