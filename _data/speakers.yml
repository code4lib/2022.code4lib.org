Her projects included tracking the disparate effects of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, analyzing policing budgets and practices, and advocating for regulation of government facial surveillance.<br/><br/>
    Lauren received her Bachelor's degree from Yale in 2017, where she double-majored in astrophysics and African American studies.
