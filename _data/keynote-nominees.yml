    Crystal is a Ph.D. student at MIT. To quote from her web site, "I work broadly on topics related to the social and political dimensions of computing, data visualization, and disability. I also conduct ethnographic and computational research on social media communities like COVID skeptics, Chinese cyber-nationalist fandoms, and data hoarders." She did an amazing paper on how COVID skeptics use data visualization practices to promote misinformation, hence how information literacy is altogether more complicated than it seems.

    Archipelago is an open source repository system developed and supported by the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO). Conceived 3 years ago as a response to our communitiesâ€™ need (New York State) to lower the technological barriers of using and maintaining such systems and our experience maintaining and developing other open source repositories, Archipelago has come a long way, from a simple idea to many successful implementations. An extensive, thoughtful planning process turned into a formal roadmap that guided the development of a novel paradigm, coded with care for and supported by a diverse community. This presentation is about multi-sided Openness, a tale of rethinking our historical notions of what domain driven systems are in our shared professional realms, of stepping back, of giving users the tools for building on their own practices, of removing ourselves (developers) from imposing preconceived shapes data and media should have. In an evolving and constantly shifting domain, we provide means that support local, identity-driven workflows, enabling exploration and iterative actions leading to making knowledge more open, for human and machine consumption.
