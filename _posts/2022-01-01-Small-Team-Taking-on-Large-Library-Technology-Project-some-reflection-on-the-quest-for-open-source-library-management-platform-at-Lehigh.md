title: Small Team Taking on Large Library Technology Project&#58; some reflection on the quest for open source library management platform at Lehigh
---
Lehigh University is one of the Open Library Environment (OLE) Initiative founding partners and was one of the first implementers of the OLE library management system in the summer of 2014. Lehigh has been actively involved in the FOLIO Collaboration since the projectâ€™s inception in 2016 and implemented FOLIO in summer 2020. We will share about our experiences of two successful open source ILS migrations, improving library operational efficiencies through customized application development using OLE and FOLIO APIs, continued involvement in the OLE and FOLIO community to help shape the system development, and how we managed to do it with a small technology team of three.
