title: Turnover Blues - The Need for Succession Planning for Technical Library Positions
---
Organizations often create succession plans for leadership positions but do not take the same care for ensuring continuity for technical & technology driven positions. This lack of planning, in conjunction with turnover, creates a gap that hinders knowledge transfer and prohibits forward progress. Succession planning in these positions is an integral part of organizational management and strategic planning. This presentation aims to describe a basic succession plan that can be utilized in libraries for technical & technology driven positions.
