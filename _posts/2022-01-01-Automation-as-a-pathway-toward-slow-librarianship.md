title: Automation as a pathway toward slow librarianship
---
Automation is generally touted as a means to increase efficiency, but can it also be a tool for slowing down? This talk will explore how automating tedious and time-consuming tasks can create space for more meaningful work and how writing code can be a contemplative practice that can lead to a deeper understanding of the problems we're trying to solve.
