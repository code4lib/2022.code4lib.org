title: Finding Aids Redesign&#58; How we improved thousands of legacy finding aids and upgraded a 20 year old web publishing process
---
Our digital library team is designing a new finding aids publishing tool for archivists at NYU Libraries and five partner sites. The project is driven by three main objectives: to replace an outdated XSLT stylesheet publishing method; to improve usability for patrons; and to address shortcomings for displaying digital archival objects. In this talk we will present our work in progress on a new application and workflow that allows archivists to preview and publish finding aids along with our new design for published content. We will discuss our process for creating a data model to map EAD data exported from ArchivesSpace into JSON for use with Hugo, an open-source static site generator. And we will present our overall systems design for a suite of micro services used to automate and scale this process.
