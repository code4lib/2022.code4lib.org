learning-outcomes: The focus of the session will be to present an overview of how modern Drupal sites are constructed and maintained, with emphasis on the use of Composer to build the site. We will cover the capabilities inbuilt to Drupal Core, and the most frequently employed contributed modules.
attendee-requirements: To get the most from this session, attendees should have a laptop. For windows users, I suggest that they install WSL. Locked down institutional computers might not work that well. General familiarity with the command line will be handy.
