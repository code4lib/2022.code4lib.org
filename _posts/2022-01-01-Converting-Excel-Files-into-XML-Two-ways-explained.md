title: Converting Excel Files into XML&#58; Two ways explained
---
In this session, presenters will explain two ways to convert excel files into XML files. My university is going through Esploro implementation for institutional repository where a lot of information is required to import using XML format (including title, department, education, etc). We usually gather data in excel format, so converting excel into xml becomes a routine task for this project. Presenters will share how they work with student workers and come up with two ways of converting excel files into XML format. One is a traditional programming approach using Python. The other is using excel built in function where non-programmer can create an XML file in a matter of minutes. Presenters will cover pro and cons of each approach and share the code for other institution to use as well.
