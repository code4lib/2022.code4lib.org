This presentation features Oklahoma State University (OSU) Library’s ongoing efforts toward Linked Open Data (LOD), using Wikidata to establish Oklahoma Native artists’ notability within the Wiki-community. The Oklahoma Native Artists (ONA) collection features first-person accounts from self-identified Native artists that document the complex history of Indian Territory, the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act, and current state legislation regulating who may market their work as a Native American artist. We have been developing LOD for these artists, their exhibition histories, awards, and published bibliographies to build a foundation for researching the artists and visualizing their connections within the community as well as in publications and museums. But while LOD may help improve artists’ visibility and notability, LOD also raises ethical concerns of balancing more inclusive data with individuals’ rights to agency and self-representation online. How we work with artists to make decisions regarding data sharing is an integral aspect of our project work in establishing reliable connections and maintaining trust between librarians and Native American communities. We will discuss our communication procedures and share our present considerations, processes, successes, and setbacks in facilitating informed decision-making and securing permission as part of this presentation.
