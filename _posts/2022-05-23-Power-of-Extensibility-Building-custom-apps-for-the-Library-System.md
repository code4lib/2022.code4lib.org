title: Power of Extensibility&#58; Building custom apps for the Library System
---
The Alma library system now supports an extensibility framework called Cloud Apps. This allows the community to build apps which integrate directly with Alma to provide custom functionality for users. Apps can be shared with other institutions in an app store-style repository.

In this session, we'll build a Cloud App using a local SDK powered by Angular, TypeScript, REST APIs, and Material Design components. This session will provide a great hands-on introduction to developing client-side apps in Angular. Developers from libraries that don't use Alma can take the skills they've learned to their next project. Libraries that use Alma will be well poised to build their own Cloud Apps which answer their users' requirements.
