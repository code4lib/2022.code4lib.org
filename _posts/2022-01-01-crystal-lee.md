[Crystal Lee](http://web.mit.edu/crystall/www/) is a PhD candidate at MIT and a Senior Fellow in Responsible Computer Science at Mozilla. Her work investigates what she calls the "life-cycle of data representations," or the process by which datasets are curated, cleaned, visualized, and circulated. In other words, she works on a wide scope of things: from the history of disability and human-computer interaction to theories about data visualization. This research has been supported by fellowships from the National Science Foundation, Social Science Research Council, and the MIT Programs for Digital Humanities. She is also a research affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard, where she co-lead the Ethical Tech Working Group. Previously, she has worked as a visiting research scientist at the European Commission and graduated with high honors from Stanford University.
