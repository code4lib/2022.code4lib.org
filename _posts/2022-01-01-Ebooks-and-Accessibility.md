With the availability of eBooks in the EPUB 3.0 format, we can deliver more accessible texts to our patrons. In this talk, I'll crack open an EPUB 3.0 and show how lessons learned from web accessibility can be applied to eBooks: offering better semantics with HTML5, for example, and ARIA roles for more precise descriptions of content. Armed with this knowledge, librarians can push vendors and publishers to supply eBooks in the EPUB 3.0 format and even, if they choose, modify the code of existing eBooks to improve accessibility (allowed under fair use).
