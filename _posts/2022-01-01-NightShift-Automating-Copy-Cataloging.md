title: NightShift&#58; Automating Copy Cataloging
---
When cataloging departments are faced with backlogs they often outsource the problem to a vendor. However, there is a better way to keep the process in-house and under full control of the library. The updated OCLC WorldCat MetadataAPI opens up possibilities to adopt a fully automated process to search the WorldCat database for newly ordered materials and perform the copy cataloging previously contracted to outside vendors or done manually by staff. This presentation will show our experiences in BookOps creating and using our copy cataloging bot for the New York Public and Brooklyn Public Library collections.
